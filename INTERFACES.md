# Interfaces

This document defines data contracts between dataset wrappers, model wrappers, losses, metrics, and MPC adapters.

## 1. Representation-Agnostic Batch Contract

All dataset wrappers should return a dict with representation-specific keys. Optional keys are omitted (not set to `None`).

### 1.1 Common keys

```python
{
    "representation": str,      # eulerian | lagrangian | ...
    "physics": Tensor[B, P],    # optional, normalized when used by model
    "metadata": dict,           # optional run/sample metadata
}
```

### 1.2 Eulerian batch example

```python
{
    "input":   Tensor[B, C, H, W],
    "target":  Tensor[B, H, W],
    "physics": Tensor[B, P],
}
```

### 1.3 Lagrangian batch example

```python
{
    "a_cur":            Tensor[B, N],
    "s_cur":            Tensor[B, N, 3],
    "s_delta":          Tensor[B, N, 3],
    "target_particles": Tensor[B, N, 3],
    "particle_dens":    Tensor[B],
    "particle_nums":    Tensor[B],       # optional for variable particle count
    "physics":          Tensor[B, P],    # optional
}
```

Rules:
- Consumers must branch by available keys (or `representation`) rather than assuming `input`/`target` always exist.
- Eulerian channel conventions are representation-local and documented under the Eulerian section.
- Representation conversion (particle to grid, action rasterization) should happen in transform/wrapper layers, not in generic trainers.

Extended optional keys (migration-safe):

```python
{
    "current_occupancy": Tensor[B, H, W],
    "target_occupancy":  Tensor[B, H, W],
}
```

When present, Eulerian losses should prefer explicit occupancy keys over implicit channel slicing.

## 2. Model Output Contract

External consumers should treat model output as a structured pair:

```python
ModelOutput(
    logits=Tensor[B, 1, H, W] | Tensor[B, H, W],
    probabilities=Tensor[B, 1, H, W] | Tensor[B, H, W] | None,
)
```

Contract:
- `logits` are raw unconstrained outputs.
- `probabilities` are occupancy probabilities in `(0, 1)`.
- If `probabilities` is missing, callers derive it with `torch.sigmoid(logits)`.

This removes ambiguity at train/eval/MPC boundaries.

## 3. Core Signatures

### 3.1 Generic training wrapper

```python
ModelTrainingWrapper.forward(batch: dict) -> Tensor | ModelOutput
```

This signature is representation-agnostic; tensor shapes depend on model family.

### 3.2 Eulerian model signatures

```python
forward(x: Tensor[B, 2, H, W], props: Tensor[B, 3]) -> Tensor[B, 1, H, W]
```

Returns raw logits. Sigmoid is applied by losses/metrics or wrappers.

### 3.3 Lagrangian model signatures (GNN)

```python
PropNetDiffDenModel.predict_one_step(
    a_cur: Tensor[B, N],
    s_cur: Tensor[B, N, 3],
    s_delta: Tensor[B, N, 3],
    particle_dens: Tensor[B],
) -> Tensor[B, N, 3]
```

Lagrangian dynamics operate on particle states directly, with no occupancy-grid requirement at model input.

### 3.4 Adapter surface for MPC

```python
obs_to_state(obs_np) -> state
expand_state(state, n_sample: int) -> state_batch
predict_step(state_batch, act_batch) -> state_batch
compute_reward(state_batch) -> reward_batch
```

Adapter state is representation-specific:
- Eulerian state: occupancy grid tensor `(B, Nx, Ny)`
- Lagrangian state: particle tensor `(B, N, 3)`

## 4. Eulerian Representation Details

This section is specific to Eulerian wrappers and occupancy-based models.

### 4.1 Coordinate conventions

Genesis world frame:
- `world_x`: table right
- `world_y`: table forward
- `world_z`: up

EulerianWrapper occupancy convention:
- 2D grid uses `dim 0 = world_x`
- 2D grid uses `dim 1 = -world_y`

Dataset/grid convention:
- Grid tensors use `dim 0 = world_y` (rows)
- Grid tensors use `dim 1 = world_x` (cols)

Bridge requirement:
Any conversion path between wrapper-state and dataset-state must apply the same flip/transpose policy in forward and inverse directions.

### 4.2 Sigmoid requirement at MPC boundary (Eulerian)

Reward paths clamp states to `[0, 1]`. Feeding raw logits into this clamp saturates gradients and can silently kill optimization.

Required behavior:
- MPC-facing predictions must be occupancy probabilities in `(0, 1)`.
- If model internals are logit-based, convert before returning from the MPC-facing wrapper.

## 5. Lagrangian Representation Details

This section is specific to particle-based models and adapters.

### 5.1 State and action semantics
- State is particle positions (and optionally per-particle attributes), not an occupancy grid.
- Actions are converted to per-particle displacement fields before model rollout.
- Rewards for optimization should match particle representation when possible.

### 5.2 Reporting compatibility
- Cross-model comparison may project particles to occupancy for reporting only.
- This projection should not replace representation-native optimization losses/rewards.

## 6. Compatibility Notes

- Legacy callers can still pass raw tensors; helper conversion utilities should normalize this to the ModelOutput contract.
- New code should prefer explicit typed contracts in `training/types.py`.
- Representation-specific losses/metrics should validate required keys early and fail loudly on mismatch.
